## Project Description
The Embedded System Design project is a collaborative effort to build and design an embedded system using key models in the field.

## Design Models
1. **Time Model**
   - Responsible for time management within the embedded system.
   - Ensures synchronization of tasks and events over time.

2. **Event Driven Model**
   - Handles events within the system based on tasks and triggering conditions.
   - Optimizes resource usage by flexibly responding to events.

3. **Multi-tasking Model**
   - Manages multiple tasks concurrently to optimize system performance.
   - Efficiently shares resources among running tasks.

## Usage Guidelines
1. **System Requirements**
   - Ensure that your system meets the necessary requirements.

2. **Installation**
   - Follow the installation steps provided in the documentation.

3. **Running the Project**
   - Describe in detail how to run and test the project.
